# This is because, to make a figure in ggplot, you need to write additional lines of code.
# The most important code to add is the code for one or more **geoms**
# Geoms which specify the shape of the visualized data.
# Geoms you might use in this lab include:
# - ```geom_point()``` to make a scatterplot
# - ```geom_boxplot()``` to make a boxplot (obviously)
# - ```geom_bar()``` to make a barplot (though see below)
# - ```geom_smooth()``` to add a trendline/line of best fit to another geom (usually a scatterplot)
# - ```geom_errorbar()``` to add error bars to a barplot
# Most geoms can be used "empty",
# but others (like ```geom_bar()```) will require specifying things within the parentheses.
# Even for those that don't, there's often a lot of stuff you **can** add within them to customize your graph.
